Practical Machine Learning Project

Summary
Using wearable devices it is possible to record personal activity. The large amount of data recorded need to be analyzed to take full advantage of these devices. Machine learning algorithms can be used to perform these analysis. In this project, I used data from wearable accelerometers (on belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell) in 6 participants. Participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise by using machine learning. The results indicated that the Random Forest model correctly predict whether barbell lifts were performed correctly when weareable devices are used.
